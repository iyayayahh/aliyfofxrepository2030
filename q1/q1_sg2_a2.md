## ***Instructions:***
### **The Problem: Finding the highest (Maximum) number from a given list of numbers.**

PseudoCode 1
```
Algorithm FindMax1(numbers)
   max ← numbers[0]
   For i from 1 to length(numbers)-1
      If numbers[i] > max Then
         max ← numbers[i]
      EndIf
   EndFor
   Return max
EndAlgorithm
```

PseudoCode 2
```
Algorithm FindMax2(numbers)
   For i from 0 to length(numbers)-1bigger ← true
      For j from 0 to length(numbers)-1
         If numbers[j] > numbers[i] Then
            bigger ← false
         EndIf
      EndFor
      If bigger = true Then
         Return numbers[i]
      EndIf
   EndFor
EndAlgorithm
```
